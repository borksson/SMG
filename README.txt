The Caves of Drah.
Description:
This is an eight-bit RPG with no purpose besides survive. All creatures
are randomly generated, and each provide a different power necessary to
continue. They are: Health, Stamina, and Magic. Heath decreases when you are
hit by a creature, stamina decreases when you run or melee attack, and magic
decreases when you cast. The game ends when you run out of health. You gain
health, stamina, and magic from colored creatures. Upgrades to your bars come
from boss fights of each color. Colorless creatures do not drop anything.
Defeat many creatures and bosses to get the high score!
